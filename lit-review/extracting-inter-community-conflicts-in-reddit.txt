- subreddit level conflicts - conflicts are reciprocated
- social and anti-social homes - political subreddit vs local subreddit

"To achieve this, we address a number of challenges. First
among them is the lack of explicit group membership. Group
‘membership’ in Reddit, and systems like it, can be vague.
While subscriptions are possible, individuals can display
member-like behaviors by posting to subreddits they are
not part of. Such behaviors—subscription and posting—are
not, however, a clear indication of the individual’s ‘social
homes.’ An individual can display both social and anti-social
behaviors within the community via posting. What we seek
is not simply identifying an individual’s ‘home’ but to also
discriminate between social homes and anti-social homes.

To achieve this separation, we apply a definition that ext
ends Brunton’s construct of spam (Brunton 2012): a community defines spam as (messaging) behavior that is not consistent with its rules and norms. That is, we seek to separate
norm-complaint behaviors that indicate social membership
and those that are norm-violating (indicating an anti-social
home). Rather than relying on a global definition of norms,
we utilize the sanctioning and rewarding behavior of individual subreddits in response to norm violation and compliance
respectively. An explicit measure we leverage is up- and
down-voting on posted comments. While these are not the
only sanctions and rewards, they are (a) consistently used,
and (b) can be aggregated both at the individual and community levels. As we demonstrate below, inference based on
these lower level signals can help identify broader conflicts."
