\chapter*{Abstract}
\par The abstract is mandatory.
\par The maximum acceptable length for an abstract to be published in Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) is 350 words. The maximum acceptable length for an abstract to be published in Master’s Thesis Directories (MTD) is 150 words. However, an abstract within the dissertation or thesis need not be limited. The student may prepare a lengthy abstract for inclusion in the thesis or dissertation and a more concise summary for publication in DAI/MTD. 
\par The abstract is expected to give a succinct account of the student's work so that a reader can quickly learn the essential contents and results. A typical abstract includes a statement of the problem, an account of procedure or methods followed, and an account of main results and conclusions.
\par Abstracts must be prepared carefully, since they are published in DAI/MTD without editing or revision.

Indicate that your studies or articles are being included because they were part of the programmatic line of research that comprised the dissertation and that including them provides a coherent and appropriately sequenced investigation. Describe your (the dissertation author) role in the published work. Certify that permission to republish these works in the dissertation has been obtained from the publisher or owner. 
\par For images, identify the ones for which permission has been received by figure number and with reference to the copyright holder (whether an individual or institution) and certify that permission has been obtained.

\chapter{Subreddit-level Analysis}

\section{Data Overview}
\par The subreddit-level analysis requires a variety of different data inputs. These data inputs can be divided into two major subcategories: post and comment data from Reddit itself and data that provide contextual or qualitative information.

\subsection{Reddit Data}
\par The Reddit dataset contains posts from the subreddits of the 384 MSAs of the United States as of March 2020 (REF). Appendix (REF) provides a full list of subreddits used. From this list of subreddits, we scrape and store all posts that users submit. In total, 161,166 posts were gathered between April 5, 2022 and May 31, 2022. (REF - Figure of timeline). The datastore archives posts in two formats. First, posts are written to a system of record to ensure that there is an authoritative data source that can be referenced. Second, pertinent information, such as post title and author, is extracted from the posts data stream and placed in a separate datastore.

\par After storing data, an analysis tool runs to determine if a post is about crime. To do this, a regular expression checks if a post's title or a post's link's URL contains a crime-related keyword. Appendix (REF) lists the keywords used. These keywords were derived from actions that constitute violent crime and their synonyms, as well as generic crime-related words. If the regular expression returns a hit, a flag is raised in the database denoting that the post is about crime. Overall, 6,792 posts are estimated to discuss crime.

\subsection{Contextual Data}
\par A variety of data were utilized to highlight trends in the Reddit posts. One variable that subreddits are compared to is population size of the MSA (REF). These values range from a minimum of 58,639 (Carson City, NV) and a maximum of 20,140,470 (New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA). MSAs are categorized into four bins based on their size: large, medium, small, and very small. The population cutoffs are 1,000,000, 500,000, and 200,000. The large population contains 56 members, the medium bin contains 54 members, the small bin contains 113 members, and the very small bin contains 161 members. Appendix (REF) contains the populations of all MSAs.

\par Another variable that provides context is the political climate of an MSA. For this, we consider the results of the 2020 election (REF) in terms of the percent of the MSA voting Democrat. These values range from a minimum of 20.2\% (Morristown, TN) to a maximum of 80.9\% (Santa Cruz-Watsonville, CA). The MSAs are categorized into five bins based on their voting results: Very Conservative, Conservative, Moderate, Liberal, and Very Liberal. The percentage cutoffs for the bins are 37.5\%, 47.5\%, 52.5\%, and 62.5\%. The Very Conservative bin contains 112 members, the Conservative bin contains 103 members, the Moderate bin contains 57 members, the Liberal bin contains 73 members, and the Very Liberal bin contains 39 members. Appendix (REF) contains the voting patterns of all MSAs.

\par A third variable that is considered is the documented violent crime rate of each MSA. This data is derived from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting statistics (REF / Footnote) \footnote{Data from the FBI mostly comes from the year that is most recent, 2019. However, not all municipalities report information, so there are slight estimations in the data (REF). Additionally, not all MSAs have documented 2019 data, so 2018 or 2017 data are used instead. The year gathered is documented in Appendix (REF)}. These values range from a minimum of 44.3/100,000 (Bangor, ME) to a maximum of 1,397.2/100,000 (Birmingham-Hoover, AL). Documented crime data is also normalized using min-max normalization so that it can be compared to a similarly normalized crime discussion value from the Reddit data. Appendix (REF) contains the documented crime rate of all MSAs.
